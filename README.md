## ðŸ©º Features

* **Lung Cancer Detection**: Detects malignant and benign lung conditions from CT scan images using a deep learning model.
* **Prediction from Reports**: Analyzes patient reports using a separate AI model for prediction.
* **Interactive UI**: Modern and responsive interface for smooth user experience.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: PyQt5, Tkinter
* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **AI/ML**: TensorFlow/Keras for image and text models
* **Other Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Flask

## ðŸ§  Model Integration

* **Image Model**: `lung_cancer_model.keras`
  Processes CT scan images and classifies them as benign or malignant.

* **Text Model**: `model.pkl`
  Predicts lung cancer risk from patient medical reports.

---

## âš¡ Usage

1. Upload a lung CT scan image or enter a patient report.
2. Get real-time predictions for lung cancer detection.
